    <h1>FAITH AND HOPE</h1>

    <p>Life is a journey filled with faith and hope. Every challenge we face is not a punishment but a lesson shaping who we are meant to become — a bridge drawing us closer to God and the Holy Virgin Mary.</p>
    <p>The Holy Virgin Mary covers me in mercy and protection. Life is not picture perfect; there are struggles and worries, yet I keep reminding myself that God’s timing is perfect and His mercy is endless.</p>
    <p>Just as the darkest nights give birth to the brightest stars, our struggles prepare us for greater strength, wisdom, and grace. Life can't be free from pain, but those pains aren't meant to destroy us — they make us more mature, wiser, and more compassionate.</p>
    <p>Every hardship is guidance for who we are as a person. Every phase we pass through is necessary, leading us step by step into the person we are becoming. And so, I rest in this truth: whatever will be, will be. The future is not ours to see, but if it is meant to happen, it will.</p>
    <p>All I must do is hold onto faith, for God’s will is always greater than my own.</p>
